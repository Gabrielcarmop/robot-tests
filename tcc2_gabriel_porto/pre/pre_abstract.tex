\begin{abstract}{Automatic Test Case Generation for Robot Framework: An Artificial Intelligence–Based Approach}
	This work presents the development and evaluation of a functional test automation solution integrated with artificial intelligence mechanisms. The proposed approach employs Robot Framework and Selenium WebDriver to perform automatic failure detection in web applications, complemented by an intelligent analysis module that interprets errors during test execution using the Gemini API. Additionally, the solution integrates directly with GitHub Actions and GitHub Issues, enabling the automatic creation of defect reports containing detailed evidence such as screenshots, logs, and AI-generated diagnostic hypotheses. This applied research explores how the combination of test automation, artificial intelligence, and continuous integration practices can enhance traceability, efficiency, and reliability within the software quality assurance process.
